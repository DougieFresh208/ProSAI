# CAO M INSTRUCTION 1: FILING A PETITION FOR MODIFICATION

The court may grant a modification (change) of child custody, visitation, or child support if there has been a substantial and material change in your circumstances and if it is in the best interest of your minor child/ren to do so. However, if there has only been a brief period of time since the entry of the last order, judgment or decree, or if the child/ren has/have not lived in Idaho for at least six months, the court may not grant your Petition unless there was a clerical mistake in the earlier order, judgment or decree, or if an emergency exists. The minimum time required may depend on these factors: the individual judge, the type of modification sought, whether the parties are in agreement as to the modification, whether the previous order, judgment or decree was entered in Idaho or another jurisdiction and other circumstances. These instructions outline the process for modifying an Idaho order, judgment, or decree.

**Step 1. Talk to an Attorney, if Possible.**
WARNING: When you represent yourself in a court case you are held to the same standard as an attorney. This applies to your preparation of paperwork and your conduct at all hearings and/or trial. Your lack of legal knowledge may cause you to make serious errors in handling your case. These instructions are not a substitute for legal advice. The laws and court rules are complex and following these instructions will not guarantee that your rights are protected or that you will be satisfied with the result. You should always talk to a lawyer about your legal problems before filing any legal paperwork. Even if you do not hire a lawyer to appear in your case, you may be able to find a lawyer to review your paperwork or give you more information about your rights. Call the Idaho State Bar (208-334-4500) to provide you with the name of an attorney who handles this type of case. Contact the Court Assistance Office for information about resources for low-income people, or visit the Idaho Supreme Court’s Self-Help Center at http://www.courtselfhelp.idaho.gov/.

**Step 2. Complete the Required Forms.**
Before you begin to complete the forms, make a copy of the entire set of forms to use as a “working copy”. Additional forms cannot be provided without charge. You will complete the forms by typing or neatly printing in black ink.
If the other parent agrees to the change and will sign both documents, you may complete and file a Stipulation for Modification, CAO M 6-1, and the Judgment of Modification, CAO 8-2, may be issued without a hearing and without the twenty-one (21) day wait. (See CAO M Instruction 2, Agreed Modification of Child Custody, Visitation, or Support.)

If the other parent does not agree with the change, or will not sign documents to make the change, you will need to complete and file the following forms to begin the modification procedure:
- Petition to Modify an Order, Judgment, or Decree, CAO M 1-1
- Summons with Orders, CAO FL 1-3

If you are asking the judge to change the custody arrangements, you may need to complete a proposed Parenting Plan Agreement which you will attach to the Petition.

**Step 3: Make Copies and File with the Clerk.**
Make copies of the Petition to Modify an Order, Judgment or Decree, and the Summons with Orders for each party in the case.
Go to the window in the Clerk's Office and give the Deputy Clerk:
- The signed original Petition to Modify and copies for each party (with copies of Parenting Plan and child support documents stapled to each copy)
- The original Summons with Orders and copies for each party
- The appropriate filing fee or Motion and Affidavit for Fee Waiver and two copies of a proposed Judgment Re: Fee Waiver (CAO FW 1-9 & CAO FW 1-10).
The Clerk will “conform” the copies by stamping and dating them. This will provide proof of the filing of the documents in case they become misplaced from the court file.

**Step 4: Obtain Service on the Other Party/s.**
You now need to serve the Petition to Modify, and Summons with Orders (and Order to Attend Parenting Workshop, if applicable) on the other party/ies. There are three different ways you can do this. You only need to serve the other party/ies one of these ways.

**Step 5. Wait 21 Days.**
The other party/ies has/have twenty-one (21) days from the date of service to respond to your Petition for Modification. If there is no response filed within that period, you may make an application for “default” to be entered and to have your Judgment signed. For this purpose, the date the other party/ies was/were served was either 1) the date he/she signed the Acknowledgment of Service form; or 2) the date the process server delivered the papers to the other party; or 3) the last date the papers were published in a newspaper.

**Step 6. Complete Default paperwork, make Copies and File with the Clerk.**
When twenty-one (21) days have ended, if there has been no response from the other party complete the following forms, make one copy for your records and file the original with the court:
- Motion and Affidavit for Entry of Default
- Default

**Step 7. Complete the Final Forms, Have Them Reviewed, Make Copies and Prepare Envelopes.**
- Judgment of Modification with all necessary supporting documents attached (Parenting Plan or Child Support Order). Make copies for each party.
- Stamped envelopes addressed to yourself and the other party(s) for the Clerk to mail a copy of the Judgment of Modification with all attachments.
- Child Support Order Transmittal Form (this is required only if child support is modified).
- Make an appointment with the Court Assistance Office to have all of your paperwork reviewed before it is presented to the judge.

**Step 8. Read the Response.**
Read the other party’s response carefully. If the other party’s response is a statement of agreement, you will not have to prepare for a contested hearing. But if the other party disagrees with your Petition or you are unsure about any of the allegations or terms in the response, you should talk to an attorney as soon as possible to learn what your rights are and what course of action to take.

**Step 9: Comply with Mandatory Disclosures of Information**
If either party has requested a change to child support, you have to provide income information to the other party within 35 days from the day they filed the response. This will include tax returns, W-2 forms, and many other forms, see Instruction CAO FL Inst 5-1 for further details and use forms CAO FLPi 5-1 Petitioner’s/Respondent’s Mandatory Child Support Disclosures and CAO CvPi 4-5 Certificate of Service.

**Step 10: Follow all Court Orders.**
Ordinarily, you will have a hearing if the other party files a document in response to your Petition. You may need to set the hearing (Notice of Hearing). You may receive various notices and/or orders from the court concerning your modification, e.g., Notice of Status Conference or Pre-trial Conference, Scheduling Order, or a Notice of Hearing. Read all court notices and orders carefully, and note the deadlines and hearing dates contained in them. Failure to meet court deadlines or to appear at scheduled conferences, hearings, or at trial may result in punishment for contempt of court or in other sanctions. Such failure may also cause you to lose some or all of your case.

**Step 11: Consider Negotiation, Mediation, or Other Means to Settle Your Case.**
The overwhelming majority of civil cases settle before trial. You should attempt to settle your case with the other parent. You can discuss settlement in person with the other parent or his/her attorney, or you may submit a written settlement offer. You might also consider mediation to resolve your dispute. Mediation is a process in which a neutral third party (called a mediator) assists the parties in their settlement negotiations. Mediation is often successful in resolving disputes concerning parenting schedules or child support. Your attorney, the court clerk, or court assistance officer can give you a list of local mediators and more information about the mediation process. There are other alternative means to settle your case without a trial. These include arbitration and appointment of a special master. If negotiation or mediation does not resolve your case, you should consult an attorney about these alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.

If you do settle your case before trial, fill out form Sworn Stipulation For Entry Of An Order, Judgment or Decree (CAO FLPi 6-1) (or Stipulation for Order, Judgment or Decree CAO GCS 6-9 H&W), and an appropriate Judgment of Modification. See CAO GCSM Instruction 8-2.

If your case does not settle before trial, see “Guidelines for Courtroom Behavior”, CAO Cv Instruction 4-1, for general information on how to proceed. The hearing will be conducted according to formal rules of evidence and procedure. You should talk to an attorney to learn how to comply with those evidentiary and procedural rules and requirements.
