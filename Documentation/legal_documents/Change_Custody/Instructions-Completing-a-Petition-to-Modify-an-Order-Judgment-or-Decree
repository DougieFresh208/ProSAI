# CAO M INSTRUCTION 1-1
## PETITION TO MODIFY AN ORDER, JUDGMENT OR DECREE

**Talk to an attorney, if possible.**

**WARNING**: When you represent yourself in a court case you are held to the same standard as an attorney. This applies to your preparation of paperwork and your conduct at all hearings and/or trial. Your lack of legal knowledge may cause you to make serious errors in handling your case. These instructions are not a substitute for legal advice. The laws and court rules are complex, and following these instructions will not guarantee that your rights are protected or that you will be satisfied with the result. You should always talk to a lawyer about your legal problems before filing any legal paperwork. Even if you do not hire a lawyer to appear in your case, a lawyer can give you more information about your rights. Call the Idaho State Bar (208-334-4500) to provide you with the name of an attorney who handles this type of case. Contact the Court Assistance Office for information about resources for low-income people, or visit the Idaho Supreme Court’s Self-Help Center at http://www.courtselfhelp.idaho.gov/.

You will be signing a sworn statement that you have read the Petition, know what it says, and believe it’s true. To guarantee the truthfulness of that statement, be sure to read the entire completed form.

## Instructions:

1. Fill in the forms by typing or by printing neatly and legibly in black ink. The documents have a boldface "or" at the start of optional sections. If the section does not contain a boldface "or," it is necessary, and you should type in the appropriate information (which might be the word "none"). Always keep a copy of the completed form for your records.

2. At the top left-hand corner of page 1, fill in your full legal name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address (if you have one).

3. **The Court Heading**: Fill in the county and judicial district in capital letters (for example, “IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SIXTH JUDICIAL DISTRICT, IN AND FOR THE COUNTY OF BANNOCK”) exactly like it is in the Order, Judgment or Decree you are asking to be changed.

4. **The Caption**: Fill in the names of the Petitioner and Respondent exactly as they appeared in the caption in the original case.

5. **The Case No.**: Fill in the case number from the original court case. This is not the same as your Department of Health and Welfare Child Support case number.

6. **Fill in your full legal name and check the box to indicate if you are the mother or the father.**

7. Fill in the name and date of birth for each minor child and the city and state where each child has lived for the last five years. If none of the children and no parent still live in Idaho, the Idaho court may lack authority (“jurisdiction”) to modify custody. In that event you should consult an attorney to determine whether there may be other grounds for jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, Section 32-11-203, I.C.

8. Write in the city, county and state where Mother resides and the city, county and state where Father resides.

9. **UCCJEA Jurisdiction**: You are required to inform the court if there have been any other cases involving your child/ren in any court or if there are any other people claiming custody or visitation rights with the child/ren. In paragraphs 3a, b, c, and d, check the appropriate box and provide all requested information.

10. **Before asking the court to modify (change) the order, judgment or decree now in effect, you must provide information to the court explaining what significant (“substantial and material” for child support) change(s) in circumstances make the modification necessary.** Check the box/es that describe the change(s) that have occurred since the most recent order, judgment or decree. If none of the boxes apply, provide your own description of the changes.

11. **Custody**: Check the first box if there will be no change.

    - Check the second box if you are seeking to have the previous order, judgment or decree modified with respect to custody (or “Parenting Plan”) and write in the date of the most recent Decree or Order of Custody. Consult the court file if you are unsure about the date of the most recent order or decree. Note: There may be different orders if you have changed either support or custody before.

    **Legal Custody**. “Joint legal custody” means the parents are required to share the decision-making rights, responsibilities, and authority relating to the health, education, and general welfare of the child/ren. The court will award joint legal custody unless you can prove it would not be in the best interest of the minor child/ren for the other parent to share the decision-making rights.

    - Check the first box if there will be no change.

    - Check the second box if both parents are fit persons to share the decision-making rights, responsibilities, and authority relating to the health, education, and general welfare of the child/ren.

    - Check the third box if you are declaring that one parent should have sole legal custody of the child/ren, and write in the name of the parent who should be awarded sole legal custody and state why the other parent should NOT be allowed to share legal custody.

    **Physical Custody**. “Joint physical custody” means each parent has significant periods of time in which a child resides with or is under his/her care and supervision. Joint physical custody assures the child/ren frequent and continuing contact with both parents but does not necessarily mean the child spends exactly the same amount of time with each parent. The court will award joint physical custody unless you can prove it would not be in the best interest of the minor child/ren.

    - Check the first box if there will be no change.

    - Check the second box if both parents should be given physical custody of the child/ren and complete the Parenting Plan. (Both parents may sign the Parenting Plan, but it is not required). Write Exhibit A on the bottom of the first page of the Parenting Plan and attach (staple) it to the Petition for Modification. IMPORTANT: The Parenting Plan must be attached to make it a part of the Petition for Modification. Make an extra copy of the Parenting Plan to attach (staple) to the Judgment of Modification.

    - Check the third box if you are asking the court to give sole physical custody of the child/ren to only one parent, and write in the name of the parent who should be given sole physical custody and state why the other parent should NOT be given periods of time when the child/ren reside with or is under his/her care and supervision. If you want the court’s order to give the other parent restricted or conditional time with the child/ren, write in the parent’s name and state specifically what you want the court to order; or check the box to refer to the Parenting Plan you will attach (staple) to your Petition.

12. **Child Support**: Note: If the percentage of time the child/ren is with each parent is changed, the amount of child support will probably also need to be changed. Before you complete this section, you will first need to complete an Affidavit Verifying Income and a Child Support Worksheet. A Court Assistance Officer will be able to help you generate these documents if you provide the required information. The Child Support Worksheet will be used to complete this section. If you want the court to enter a support amount that is different from the Idaho Child support Guidelines amount, you must come to court for a court hearing and persuade a judge why that is in the best interests of your children and meets their financial needs.

    - If there is already an order, judgment, or decree signed by a judge, for example in a different case filed by the Department of Health & Welfare, that sets child support, check the first box, and if you want that order, judgment or decree to continue and control child support instead of getting a new order, judgment or decree, check the second box. Then make a copy of that Order, Judgment or Decree, mark it as Exhibit B and attach (staple) it to the Petition to Modify. Do not complete the remaining portions of paragraph 6. Or check the third box if you believe there are substantial and material reasons why the child support set in the other case should be changed by an order issued in this case which would control future child support payments.

    **Warning**: You should be aware that jurisdiction as to child support is a complicated issue and having a child support order, judgment or decree in a separate case can create problems for enforcement and future modifications. If the child support order is in a different case and you want to change it, that case and this case will need to be consolidated so the child support can be modified. Even if you want child support to be controlled by the separate order, your judge may require you to consolidate that case with your Modification, and serve the Petition to Modify on the Department of Health and Welfare.

    **And/Or** If you want to modify the current child support order, judgment or decree in this case, or in a separate case, or if there is no child support order, check the fourth box, and write in the name of the parent who will pay child support and from the child support worksheet, insert the basic monthly child support before any adjustments and the day of the month you want the payments to be made. In paragraph 6a, if you have more than one minor child, check the box. You will need to have a separate calculation to reflect the changed amount of support as each child is no longer eligible for support under Idaho law. These calculations are provided if you have used a computer program to calculate child support. A Court Assistance Officer can help you with these calculations if you do not have them.

    - Write in the name of the parent who will pay child support and the total monthly amount (the base amount of support plus or minus any adjustments for work-related child care expenses, health insurance premiums and/or the tax dependency).

    - Fill in the Base Amount of child support

    - If your child support calculation includes adjustments for sharing work-related child care costs, health insurance premiums, and/or tax benefits, check the boxes that apply and fill in the amounts.

    - If you have more than one minor child, check the box. You will need to have a separate calculation to reflect the changed amount of support as each child is emancipated (no longer eligible for support under Idaho law). Fill in the total amount of child support from the child support worksheet.

    - Attach your Affidavit Verifying Income and Support Worksheet(s) to the Petition, marking each as Exhibit B.

    **Warning**: If you are the parent paying child support (the “obligor”) you should be aware the decree will provide for collection of unpaid child support from your wages and from your real estate or personal property. The decree will also provide that if you move to another state, the child support award (and any spousal maintenance award) can be enforced directly by courts in other states. Additionally, you should be aware that, according to Idaho law, if unpaid child support equals or exceeds the total support owing for ninety (90) days or the sum of $2,000, whichever is less, you are subject to suspension of any license to practice or engage in any business, occupation, or profession, operate a motor vehicle, carry a concealed weapon, or engage in any recreational activity, including hunting or fishing. Further, the State Tax Commission will withhold and set-off any state tax refund to collect any unpaid child support, or unpaid spousal support, and the Idaho State Lottery will likewise withhold and set-off a prize of a lottery prize-winner.

13. **Extended Visits**:

    - In paragraph 6b, check the first box if the child/ren will be living in the home of one parent at least 75% of the time under your proposed parenting plan. If you do not check this box, go directly to paragraph 6c. Otherwise, check the second box in paragraph 6b if you want the court to order a reduction in child support when the parent paying child support has physical custody of the child/ren for 14 or more overnights in a row. Next, check the appropriate box to indicate if the reduction should be 50% or some other percentage.

    - Check the next box if you have more than one child, but the parent paying child support will have some, but not all of the children for a period of 14 overnights in a row. If this box is selected, the reduction of support will be applied only to the child/ren who are actually with the parent paying child support during those 14 overnights in a row.

    **Note**: If the child/ren reside with each parent more than 25% of the time (overnights), this is considered shared physical custody and certain adjustments are made in the calculation of child support. Section 10(e) of the Idaho Child Support Guidelines, Rule 6(c)(6) of the Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure, describe “Shared Physical Custody” and computation of child support with that parenting arrangement. The reduction of child support for extended visits is not permitted if child support has been calculated with a shared physical custody adjustment. You can get a copy of the Child Support Guidelines from a Court Assistance Office or the Internet at http://www.courtselfhelp.idaho.gov/.

14. **Work-Related Child Care Costs**:

    - Work-related child care costs are separate from the basic monthly child support amount contribute to the payment of work-related child care costs.

    - Check the first box if there will be no change, or check the second box in paragraph 6c you want the court to order the parent paying child support to also contribute to work-related child care costs, and fill in the percentages each parent will pay.

    - Note: Under this section you are asking the court to require each parent to pay their share directly to the care provider if permitted by the provider, otherwise, the parent who pays the costs must be reimbursed within ten days after the other parent receives a copy of the bill and proof of payment.

15. **Medical Insurance**:

    - The cost of medical, dental, and/or optical insurance for the child/ren is separate from the basic monthly child support amount. The cost is prorated between the parents in proportion to their Guidelines income.

    - Check the first if there will be no change, or check the second box in paragraph 6d if you want the court to order the parent paying child support to also contribute to medical, dental and/or optical insurance costs, and fill in the percentages each parent will pay.

    - Note: Under this section you are asking the court to require each parent to pay their share directly to the insurance provider, otherwise, the parent who pays the insurance must be reimbursed within ten days after the other parent receives a copy of the bill and proof of payment.

16. **Tax Dependency**:

    - Check the first box if there will be no change, or check the second box in paragraph 6e if you want the court to order that a child will be treated as a tax dependent on the federal income tax return of the parent paying child support, and fill in the number of exemptions. Fill in the name of the parent’s who will be claiming the child/ren for tax purposes in paragraph 6f, and if it applies, fill in the paragraph 6g. If you have more than one child, fill in the 6h.

17. **Spousal Support (Alimony)**:

    - Check the first box if there will be no change, or check the second box in paragraph 7 if you are asking for the court to order spousal support (alimony).

    - Note: If you are asking for spousal support you must also complete an Affidavit Verifying Income and a Spousal Support Worksheet. A Court Assistance Officer will be able to help you with this if you provide the required information. Mark each of these documents as Exhibit C and attach (staple) them to the Petition for Modification.

18. **Health Care**:

    - Check the first box if there will be no change, or check the second box if you want the court to order other health care relief, and fill in the required information.

19. **Support for Child 18 or Older and Still in High School**:

    - Check the first box if there will be no change, or check the second box if you want the court to order support for a child 18 years of age or older who is still in high school, and fill in the required information.

20. **Attorney Fees and Costs**:

    - Check the first box if there will be no change, or check the second box if you want the court to order the other party to pay your attorney fees and costs and fill in the total amount you are requesting. Mark your Affidavit of Attorney Fees as Exhibit D and attach (staple) it to the Petition for Modification.

21. **Other Relief**:

    - Check the first box if there will be no change, or check the second box if you want the court to order other relief and fill in the information as requested.
