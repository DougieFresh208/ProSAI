# ProSAI
AI Agent for Pro Se Litigants in Family Court Cases

**Project Overview**

ProSAI is an open-source AI agent designed to assist pro se litigants (individuals representing themselves) in family court cases, with a primary focus on custody and visitation disputes. The purpose of ProSAI is to empower users with valuable legal information, guidance, and support throughout the family court litigation process, enabling them to navigate the complexities of the legal system more effectively.

**Project Objectives**

The key objectives of ProSAI are as follows:

**Legal Guidance**

ProSAI aims to provide pro se litigants with accurate and up-to-date legal information specific to family law in Idaho. The AI agent will explain relevant statutes, regulations, and court procedures related to custody and visitation matters.

**Document Assistance**

ProSAI will offer invaluable assistance in preparing and completing essential legal documents required for family court proceedings. The AI agent will provide users with document templates and step-by-step guidance to ensure forms are accurately filled out.

**Plain Language Explanation** 

Understanding complex legal jargon can be overwhelming for pro se litigants. ProSAI is committed to simplifying legal terminology and providing explanations in plain language, making the information more accessible to individuals without a legal background.

**Process Navigation** 

Family court cases involve multiple stages, hearings, and deadlines. ProSAI will serve as a reliable guide, assisting users through each step of the process, helping them comprehend what to expect and how to prepare.

**Impartiality** 

ProSAI will remain neutral and unbiased throughout interactions with users. The AI agent will provide information and support without promoting any specific legal strategy, acknowledging that personalized legal advice should be sought elsewhere.

**Continuous Learning and Updates** 

ProSAI will continuously monitor legal developments and updates in Idaho's family law to ensure its relevance. This dedication to staying current will ensure that users receive the most accurate and up-to-date information available.

**Ethical Considerations**

ProSAI is built upon a foundation of ethical considerations to ensure user trust and fairness:

**Impartiality** 

The AI agent will provide information objectively, without favoring any party or legal approach.

**Privacy** 

ProSAI will uphold the highest standards of data privacy and security, ensuring the confidentiality of users' personal and legal information.

**No Legal Advice** 

ProSAI will clarify that it is not a substitute for professional legal advice and is intended for informational purposes only.
